# template_project_tracker
A template repository to clone each time a new NCCEH data project is begun to help manage project progress, issue tracking and other common project management tasks. 
## Setup: 
* "Fork" this repository to a new repository for your project. 
* Edit this text file ("README.md") directly in GitHub by clicking on the pencil icon to the right to manage your specific project.  
 
# [PROJECT TITLE HERE]

# PROJECT MEMBERS
In order for other people to participate in a repository, the following steps must be completed: 
1. Each person must register for an account on GitHub
2. Each person must follow this particular repository (not the template, but the project repository).  You can send them a link to the repository or simply tell them to follow you on GitHub and find the repository via your profile.
3. The owner of the repository must grant user permissions for each follower to define how they are allowed to interact with the repository.  

# TRACKING ISSUES
Issues can be tracked in the repository's "Issues" tab button (above) or at the following url: github.com/[username]/[repository]/issues.  Issue tracking is relatively self-explanatory but additional information can be found at https://docs.github.com/en

# FILES
Files can be managed and changes tracked by uploading them to the repository periodically via the "Add file" button above.  Use this space to note what files are included and the status of each. 
* filename1.xx
* filename2.xx
* etc
